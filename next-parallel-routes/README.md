# Parallel Routes

This project demonstrates the usage of **Parallel Routes** and **Conditional Routes** in Next.js, providing examples for dynamic sections, fallback handling, and conditional Routes.

## Features

- **Parallel Routes**: Allows simultaneous or conditional Routes of pages within the same layout. This is especially useful for highly dynamic sections, such as dashboards, feeds, and more.
- **default.js**: Defines a fallback page for unmatched slots.
- **Conditional Routes**: Demonstrates how to conditionally render routes based on certain conditions using Parallel Routes.
